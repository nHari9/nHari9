### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Hari!!!

### I started learning to code with Masai School with the intent to make full-stack web development my career. This was a bit of a pivot. After a college education in Mechanical Engineering, I realised I was more drawn towards the burgeoning tech industry in India. However, I knew that if I had break in to tech, I was going to need a very structured, outcome-focussed program in development. That's how I found myself at Masai School.

### Over the course of the last few months, I've worked on complex projects using programming languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MERN stack. I am innately fascinated with how products seamlessly integrate with lives, and would like to work on such platforms.

### You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hari-kishore-reddy-b158b7228/) if you want to collaborate or simply talk about tech!
